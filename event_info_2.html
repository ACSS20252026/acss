                    <p class="event-info-info" id="event-info-info">May 9, 2025 was a night to behold as hundreds of students gathered at MPH3 to attend DCSS Nights 2025! The Association of Computer Studies Students (ACSS), partnered with the League of Information Technology Students (LITS) and the Department of Computer Studies Students (DCSS), organized an eventful night full of games, performances, food, and prizes.

The theme was “Starry Night,” which the students used to pick out their elegant yet glamorous outfits. Some were even chosen as candidates for Queen and King of the Night!

The students immortalized the event through the photobooth and their own cameras.
