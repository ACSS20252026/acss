                    <p class="event-info-info" id="event-info-info">ACSS Arena: Battle of the Gaming Titans was an exhilarating gaming tournament organized by ACSS that featured two of the most popular and competitive games in the eSports scene: Teamfight Tactics (TFT) and Tekken 8.

There were limited slots for participants to ensure a high-quality and manageable event. Teamfight Tactics accepted only 24 participants, and Tekken 8 was limited to 32 participants. This was to ensure that every participant got a fair and equal chance to showcase their skills and strategies.

Tekken Participants were also allowed to bring their own controllers, ensuring they can play at their best with the equipment they were most comfortable with.</p>
